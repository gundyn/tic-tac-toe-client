Tic_Tac_Toe: A game

This application lets a user play multiple games of tic-tac-toe. I wanted to build this application to practice using the new technologies I have been learning.

Planning Story

When planning out how I was going to create tic-tac-toe application starting small and building on those success's was important. Mainly because this was a first attempt with recently learned technologies. My plan was to start with sign up and sign in, when those were working how I wanted then move on to other fuctions of the application. The game board and the logic to determine the winner or a tie was the largest hurtle i foresaw. After the functionality of the application was complete styleing the page would come. 

User Stories

As a user I want to sign in/up
As a user I want to sign in/out
As a user I want to change my password
As a user I want to start a new game
As a user I want to start as 'x'
As a user I want to see how many games I have played
As a user I don't want to see the sign up form after I sign in
As a user I don't want to see change password before I sign in
As a user I want to start a new game at anytime after sign in, even if I am in the middle of a game
As a user I don't want to see sign out before I have signed in
As a user I want the forms to be blank after I submit them

Unsolved Porblems

Still need to when a user is playing the game, the user must only select available spaces on the board

I would eventually like to allow users to veiw previous game boards
